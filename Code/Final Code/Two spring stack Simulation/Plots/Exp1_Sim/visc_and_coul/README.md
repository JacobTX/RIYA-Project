**EXPERIMENT 1 SIMULATION RESULTS - MIXED DAMPING**

This folder contains the simulation results for Experiment 1 using Mixed damping. Each subfolder is associated with the following settings.

**NOMENCLATURE**

1) scale = Factor by which the Young\'92s modulus of the material is multiplied by
2) mu = Coefficient of Coulomb friction
3) Magnitude of Coulomb Friction = mu * Fn
4) The remaining symbols used are in accordance with standard terminology.
