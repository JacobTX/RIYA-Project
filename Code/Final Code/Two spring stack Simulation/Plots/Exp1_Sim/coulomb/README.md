**EXPERIMENT 1 SIMULATION RESULTS - COULOMB FRICTION**

This folder contains the simulation results for Experiment 1 using Coulomb friction. Each subfolder is associated with the following settings

**NOMENCLATURE**

1) scale = Factor by which the Young's modulus of the material is multiplied by
2) mu = Coefficient of Coulomb friction. Magnitude of Coulomb Friction = mu * Fn
3) The remaining symbols used are in accordance with standard terminology.
