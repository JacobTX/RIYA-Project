**EXPERIMENT 1 SIMULATION RESULTS - VISCOUS DAMPING**

This folder contains the simulation results for Experiment 1 using Viscous Damping. Each subfolder is associated with the following settings

**NOMENCLATURE**

1) scale = Factor by which the Young\'92s modulus of the material is multiplied by

2) 'Experimental curve-fit model' refers to the force-deflection model obtained by curve-fitting the experimental data

3) The remaining symbols used are in accordance with standard terminology.
