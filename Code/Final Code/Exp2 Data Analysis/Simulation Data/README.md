**EXPERIMENT 2 SIMULATION DATA**


This folder contains the simulation data for Experiment 2. Each subfolder is associated with the following settings\

**NOMENCLATURE**

1) scale = Factor by which the Young's modulus of the material is multiplied by
2) mu = Coefficient of Coulomb friction. Magnitude of Coulomb Friction = mu * Fn
3) The remaining symbols used are in accordance with standard terminology.
